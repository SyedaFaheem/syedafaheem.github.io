## About
I’ve always been fascinated by patterns—how numbers behave, how people make decisions, and how small details can reshape entire systems. That curiosity led me to pursue mathematics, and later, data science and software engineering. Today, I use analytical thinking and creative problem-solving to build models, apps, and experiences that bridge the gap between data and human impact.

Whether I’m designing a predictive model, engineering a data pipeline, or developing full-stack applications, I’m driven by one goal: to create solutions that are as intuitive as they are powerful. I love challenges that push me to think deeper, learn faster, and connect ideas across disciplines.

I’m constantly exploring new ways technology can improve people’s lives—and I’m excited to continue building, learning, and innovating along the way.
